# Railway Management System
## Overview:
The provided set of code files seems to be part of a train booking system with both a command-line interface (CLI) application in C++ and a simple web interface for authentication and dashboard functionalities. The system allows users to sign up, log in, perform train operations (such as adding new trains, viewing trains, and searching trains), and manage ticket bookings (booking tickets, viewing bookings, and searching bookings). The code includes three main files: main.cpp, work.h, and script.js. Additionally, there are HTML files (index.html and dashboard.html) that seem to be used for the web interface.
## Introduction:
The train booking system is designed to provide users with a convenient way to manage train-related activities. It incorporates both a command-line interface for certain administrative tasks and a web interface for user authentication and interaction with the system. The system aims to streamline processes related to train operations, ticket booking, and user management

## Features:

### 1-User Authentication:

Users can sign up with a unique username and password.
Existing users can log in using their credentials.
### 2-Train Operations:

1-Admins can add new trains with details such as train number, route, entry price, etc.
2-Existing trains can be viewed and searched based on train number or route.
### View the list of existing trains:

Search for a specific train based on the train number.
### Ticket Booking:

1-Users can book train tickets by providing booking details like ID, passenger name, and train number.
2-Bookings can be canceled using the booking ID.
3-All bookings can be viewed, and specific bookings can be searched by ID.
### Web Interface:
A simple HTML and JavaScript-based web interface for user authentication and dashboard features.
Signup and login functionalities are implemented using local storage for simplicity
## Usage:
### 1 Command-Line Interface (C++):

Compile and run the main.cpp file to launch the CLI application.
Users can sign up, log in, and perform train and booking operations via the command line.
### 2 Web Interface:

Open the index.html file in a web browser to access the signup and login forms.
After logging in, users are directed to the dashboard (dashboard.html) where they can interact with the system using the provided buttons.
## Contributing:
Contributions to this project can be made by enhancing existing features, fixing bugs, improving the user interface, or adding new functionalities. Developers can contribute by forking the repository, making changes, and submitting pull requests.

## Learning Achievements:
### 1 C++ Programming:

Gain proficiency in C++ programming language by developing a command-line interface application for a train booking system.
Utilize features such as classes, file I/O, and basic control structures.
## 2 File Handling:

Learn file handling concepts in C++ to store and retrieve data from text files.
Implement functions to write and read data from files for user authentication, train information, and ticket bookings.
### 3 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):

Understand and apply object-oriented programming principles, including encapsulation and abstraction.
Develop classes (Auth, TrainOperations, TicketBooking) to organize and encapsulate related functionalities.
### 4 User Authentication:

Implement a simple user authentication system using C++, where users can sign up with unique usernames and passwords.
